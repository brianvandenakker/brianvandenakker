      <p>
        For the past year I've been working on a project that I'm calling{" "}
        <i>Things Past</i>. I realized that the internet still doesn't have a
        good place to share memories of our past. Every family has many boxes of
        old photos and videos that are rarely looked at. At the end of the day,
        there wasn't a very good way of sharing these memories with family and
        friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm building a platform that will allow people to upload their old
        photos and videos and share them easily. You can build profiles for each
        of your family members and tag them in photos and vidoes. You can also
        collaborate with your family members to build a family tree, write
        stories, and share memories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things Past is currently an invite only platform as we work on scaling
        and ensuring all our users have the best experience possible. I'm hoping
        to open it up to everyone else soon.{" "}
