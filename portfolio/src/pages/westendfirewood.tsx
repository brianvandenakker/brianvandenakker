        I grew up on this business. Over the last 30 years my Dad and Uncle
        built one of the largest firewood manufacturing businesses in New
        England. They worked hard and are getting ready to hand the reigns over
        to the next generation. I've been helping them build a new website and
        online ordering system. I've also built a few dashboards to automate
        their business processes and help paint a clear picture of their
        financial health. I also recently helped migrate the business to a new
        accounting system.
