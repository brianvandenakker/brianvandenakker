      <p>
        Throughout most of my 20's I would tell you my favorite books were The
        Brothers Karamazov and The Beginning of Infinity. Deutsch's book still
        holds but lately I've started to find more appeal in Tolstoy. War and
        Peace is a whole universe in itself and has really stuck with me. Here
        are some of my other favorites that I really hope you can read if you
        haven't already.
