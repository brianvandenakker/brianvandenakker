        U.S. Marine Corps Reserve

        Sometime around junior year of high school I decided I wanted to join
        the Marine Corps. I also wanted to go to college but didn't want to wait
        around for either of them. After stopping by the recruiter's office I
        learned I could do both. I had to convince my principal to let me
        graduate early despite my mediocre grades so I could finish boot camp on
        time for my first semester. He was happy to let me go.

        I ended up doing a little over 7 years with a year long deployment in
        the Pacific. I didn't enjoy it but it was a very formative experience
        and I miss it now. I was a rifleman for most of the time but was given
        the opportunity to join the intel shop during the deployment where I
        learned a lot -- especially that I have have a lot to learn about being
        a good leader.

        I was honorably discharged as a Sergeant in 2020. I miss the
        brotherhood. Society has a lot to learn from the Marines. There is a
        very real culture that permeates the institution... perhaps it's the
        strongest instution left in the U.S. right now.

        The Marine Corps is the only branch in the military not having
        recruiting issues right now. To me that teaches two lessons. One, young
        Americans are better than the zeitgeist would make you believe. If you
        ask me, anyone who's attracted to what the Marines have to offer has a
        bright future ahead of thems. Two, you can't fake culture. You have to
        really believe the values you preach. The Marines really are who they
        say they are and the American people love them for it. It's pretty
        simple, really.
